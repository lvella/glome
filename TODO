== Needs for FIKALAB game ==

- Support Windows build
- Make world updates independent of FPS
- BUG: Fix quantum tunelling of bullets
  - Bullets pass straight through some FSMs.
    - Can be time step discontinuity problem, for small FSMs.
    - Can be something wrong with the FSM radius.
    - Can be something wrong with the octree in some places.
- Transfer momentum on collision between objects (ships, flying spagetti monsters)
  - At least prevent them from intersecting, change their velocity away from one another
  - How to fit that to current crazy FSM movement?
- Fix supernova appearance:
  - you can see briefly see the other side when it is half size (you must not)
    - don't draw the opposite side to fix this
- Add collision to supernova
  - Kill player when collide, finishing the game
  - Show and register score, then ask to try again
    - Take care to make it compatible with VR UI
- Sort objects when drawing each viewport
  - Use distance to the nearest surface
- Kill flying spaghetti monsters
  - When shot
  - When collide with supernova
  - Make some cool death animation
- Make game run in solid 90 Hz
  - make it 144 Hz, if possible
  - Create a profile framework
    - Generalize the one used for measuring octree
  - Cull unseen objects
- Implement stereo rendering using OpenVR API
- Handle headset input:
  - Headset orientation changes camera view relative to ship position
- Figure VR inputs
  - Study the possibilities
  - EVA movement-like maybe?
  - 2 hand canons, maybe?
    - laser targetting
    - each cannon position given by each controller position
- Sound effects:
  - Shot
  - Hit
  - Engine fire
  - Flying spagetti monster
  - Splash into supernova
  - others?
- Visual effect of cannon fire when shooting
- Fix destroyer's double flame positions

== GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS (low priority) ==

- Bring exporter up to date with current blender
- Export meshes with CMake
- Possibly use GLM for linear algebra
- Bring code to C++11:
  - Always use "override"
  - Remove all new/delete
- Use 2 quaternion as position/orientation representation
- Port to Vulkan (maybe we can use it to improve performance)

== OLD GLOME TODO (do not apply for FIKALAB) ==

Main topics:
- Physics
- Special effects
- Multiplayer
- Improve ship file format and exporter
- To model more ships

Visual:
- Make the colors of the shots random and moving

Optimization:
- There are lots of unecessary allocations/deallocations, including in
camera history (STL containers). Remove them.

Game Mechanics:
- Add a shield that is depleted when shot
- Add a bar that measures cannons heat, so fire rate is slower when hot,
and halt when too hot;

Menu:

- Create options to configure.
- Stash options and load them at startup.
- Enhance ugly guichan buttons.
